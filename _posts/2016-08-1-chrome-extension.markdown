As developers we are always looking into ways that technology can help us be more productive. From simple things like shortcuts to implementing apps, programs that can solve a problem we come across.

During my first module as Turing Student, I decided that I wanted to create my own Chrome Extension. I was knew to programming, so I didn't have a good idea of what I wanted to implement. As just knew I wanted to have a challenge, or just learn something on the side that could be a good break between homework and all the projects at Turing (not that I had a lot of free time, Turing is intense!).

I started with a big idea of implementing an extension that would be similar to the dictionary word of the day, but would be a 'knowledge of the day', I wanted to something that could be useful for myself and other students to help absorb and retain all the methods, syntax, and etc. 

While I was reading and playing around with some Chrome Extension tutorials, and found myself getting lost with my all my bookmarked pages. I decided to hold off on my initial idea, and implement something that would be helpful for me right away. I implemented a simple Google Chrome extension to organize the most important links I was frequently using during my first module at Turing.

To me the biggest learning was just getting something done. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, but it's important to set a goal and implement little projects. I worked with my first JSON file for this extension, used some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was simple, nothing very complicated, but it was very rewarding to submit my own extension to the Chrome Store.

I still want to implement my original idea, and I'm sure this one will entail more challenges.
Start small, get something done, and move to your next challenge.

Here're some of the resources I used that were extremely helpful:
